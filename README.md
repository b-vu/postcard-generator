# Postcard Generator

## Description

Postcard Generator is a free service dedicated to providing individuals in hospitals or assisted-living facilities with uplifting cards from caring individuals across the globe.

In difficult times, a small postcard can have a big impact.

## How to get started

Providing friendship through a postcard is simple. After signing up, you can use our in-browser editor to create something that is unique that only you can make. Upload images, draw pictures, write messages; the possibilities to make an inspiring postcard are endless.

After you submit your card, it will be sent to the manager of the organization you choose, and they will hand-deliver it!

If you are an organization wishing to get postcards in the hands of your patients, you can easily add recipients to our database through our user-friendly interface. Changes to your list are painless so that you can spend less time on our site and more time with those who depend on you.

In addition to adding recipients, you will also be able to view, save, and print postcards sent to your patients in a few clicks.
